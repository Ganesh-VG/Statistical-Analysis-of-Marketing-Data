# Customer Behavior Analysis Using Descriptive Statistics

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using descriptive statistics and probability distributions. The analysis involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, calculating key statistics, exploring probability distributions, and deriving insights to make data-driven recommendations.

## Tasks and Deliverables
- Task 1: Basic CleanUp
- Task 2: Descriptive Statistics
- Task 3: Probability Distributions
- Task 4: Insights and Customer Segmentation
- Task 5: Conclusion and Recommendations

## Major chart outputs
- Probability Mass Function
  The chart forecasts the number of purchases each customer is expected to make through various purchasing methods. This allows the store to allocate more resources to the methods with higher customer engagement.

- Poisson Distribution
  These graphs suggest that for all product categories, the most likely scenario is a small percentage change in purchases, either positive or negative. The distributions are symmetric and centered around 0%, indicating that significant changes in purchasing behavior are less probable.

- Joint Distribution
   This graph shows the correalation of money spent by customers with the customer characteristics such as Income, Customer age and Customer relationship tenure.

- Average money spent by different category of people
  This graph shows the probability average money spent on purchases at store categorised by Education, Marital status, kids at home, teens at home.
