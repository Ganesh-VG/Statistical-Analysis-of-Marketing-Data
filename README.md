# Customer Behavior Analysis Using Descriptive Statistics

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using descriptive statistics and probability distributions. The analysis involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, calculating key statistics, exploring probability distributions, and deriving insights to make data-driven recommendations.

## Tasks and Deliverables

### Task 1: Basic CleanUp
- **Clean and preprocess the dataset**: Handle missing values, ensure consistent data types.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Cleaned and Preprocessed Dataset.
  - Detailed report on missing value handling and data type consistency.

### Task 2: Descriptive Statistics
- **Calculate key statistics**: Mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Summary of basic statistics in a concise table.

### Task 3: Probability Distributions
- **Identify and analyze probability distributions**: Binomial, Normal, Poisson, Geometric, and Exponential.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Probability distributions and expected values.

### Task 4: Insights and Customer Segmentation
- **Explore relationships and segment customers**: Analyze spending habits and customer characteristics.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Visualizations showcasing customer segmentation and behavior insights.

### Task 5: Conclusion and Recommendations
- **Create visualizations and recommendations**: Based on the analysis, provide actionable insights.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Well-designed visualizations and actionable recommendations.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scipy.stats

## How to Run
